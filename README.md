ontology
========

This repository is for working drafts of LD4L ontology.  Typical practice will be to check in the OWL files of existing ontologies and remove unwanted classes and properties to follow the minimum information to reference an external ontology term (MIREOT) practice described at http://obi-ontology.org/page/MIREOT. These reduced files can either then become imports to an LD4L master OWL file or be included within it, depending on size and complexity.  Should we wish to import an ontology entirety, that is also an option.
