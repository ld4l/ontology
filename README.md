# LD4L Proposed Bibframe Ontology

This bibliographic ontology is based on Rob Sanderson's and LD4L's 
recommended changes to BIBFRAME to better reflect best practices in the Linked 
Data domain. It is LD4Lâ€™s hope that derivations from BIBFRAME found in this 
ontology will be folded into the official BIBFRAME namespace. Efforts have been 
made to consider each class and property, but this ontology is largely untested. 
LD4L may provide revised/expanded versions in future as we identify new use 
cases and begin to test the ontology with instance data. The proposed changes 
include, but are not limited to, the following conventions:

1. Reuse stable pre-existing classes and properties from external ontologies 
rather than declaring new ones within the BIBFRAME namespace.

2. Use URIs rather than strings to identify resources.

3. Replace the bf:Authority classes with Real World Entity classes for people, 
places, things, etc. 

4. Define only one pattern to model one feature of the knowledge domain.

5. Clarify the directionality of properties via naming, definitions, and, where 
applicable, domain and range constraints, and add inverse properties where 
appropriate. 

6. Name terms consistently, and make the distinction between classes, object 
properties, and datatype properties clear through standard naming conventions.
